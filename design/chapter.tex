\newchapter{Scatterometer design} \label{ch:design}

In this chapter, we delve into the scatterometer design as well as the calibration and alignment process. 
% We initially establish the fundamental design considerations for constructing a kaleidoscope, and introduce a set of metrics to assess and compare various kaleidoscope designs. With this design consideraions and metrics, we simulate multiple different kaleidoscopes and evaluate their efficacy quantiatively. Additionally, we introduce the method for calibrating the extrinsic parameters of the mirrors.
