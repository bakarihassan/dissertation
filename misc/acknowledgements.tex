% I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my PhD advisors, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan and Ioannis Gkioulekas. Every interaction with them, enriched by their intelligent and insightful discussions, has consistently felt like a privilege, offering me a valuable glimpse into the ideal form of scholarly engagement I aim to pursue throughout my academic and professional life. Their mentorship has been exemplary, characterized by an enduring curiosity, a passion for learning, openness to new ideas, and a dedicated commitment to students, day and night. This has set a high standard for me and provided a solid foundation for my academic journey. My heartfelt thanks also go to my committee members, Shree K. Nayar and Manmohan Chandraker, for their valuable insights and significant contributions that have profoundly impacted my research. Their inspiring works, particularly about interreflections, have not only been mirrored in my research but also illuminated it with deeper understanding.
