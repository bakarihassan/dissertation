\newchapter{Scattering Sample Preparation} \label{ch:sample_preparation}

In this chapter, we detail the process for preparing scattering samples for scatterometer acquisition. We also discuss characterization methods used to determine the optical properties of samples necessary for the the single scattering approximation and to compute the scattering phase function.
