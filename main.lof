\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces \textbf {a}: Speckle correlation computation pipeline. The sample is illuminated by two beams, and the correlation is computed using a differential sensor. \textbf {b}: Physical setup with sample placed on the circular breadboard. The illumination stand rotates about the sample while the sensing stand measures scattered light. The differential photodetector enables fast correlation computation. \textbf {c}: Geometry used to develop forward model for inverse problem estimation of 3D beam-plane intersection points. \textbf {d}: Mean estimation errors for training and validation phases showing angular dependence of error.}}{17}{}%
