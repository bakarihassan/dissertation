\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Scattered light paths can be generally categorized as one of four types, with only type 4 making significant contributions to speckle correlation. Paths types 1 and 2 have no overlap, meaning their phases are random and cancel in expectation. Paths of type 3 generally have non-zero correlation, but their contributions are smaller than those of type 4 (single-scattering paths).}}{5}{}%
